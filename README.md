An app to track and add exercises.

To get started, download the files to your local machine. Then open the directory in a Code Editor (like VS Code or even the command line terminal), and run npm install on the root directory and the exercises-ui directory.

Then open 2 instances and simultaneously run `npm start` on the root directory and the exercises-ui directory.

Voila! You should be taken to "localhost:8000" in your browser, where the app is. 

Features to be added: Dark Mode, Deployment of app
